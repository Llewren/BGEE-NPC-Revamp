-- FAQ --
---------

Q: What versions of Baldur’s Gate does this mod work with?
A: Only Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition v2.6.6 and later has been tested

Q: Will there be romances?
A: No, and that is unlikely to change. There will be some characters that will possibly flirt and agree to a one-night stand, but it won’t go anywhere further than that.

Q: Will every companion receive a quest?
A: Some companions will receive expanded/extended content for their existing quests, rather than full new questlines — at least at this point in development.

Q: Will there be new voiced lines?
A: Unless I choose to pay for voice-acting or repurpose existing lines, then no. I will not use AI-voicing for this mod.

Q: Is the mod EET compatible?
A: I am not taking steps to make the mod EET compatible while it is still in Alpha.

Q: Is this mod related to the BG1 NPC Project?
A: No, beyond a similar name.

Q: Do I need Siege of Dragonspear to play this?
A: No.

Q: Where do I contact you about bugs or typos?
A: Contact me on the Beamdog Forums, or and leave a comment at https://smolderingmodsbar.com/
